# 🛒 E-commerce Propensity Engine

An interactive dashboard powered by an XGBoost model to predict the propensity of product returns in e-commerce. This project helps e-commerce businesses identify which products are likely to be returned, enabling better inventory management, customer targeting, and return policy optimization.

## 🎯 The Problem

E-commerce businesses lose billions of dollars annually due to product returns. This process, known as "reverse logistics," involves significant costs in shipping, inspection, restocking, and potential product devaluation. Most companies manage this reactively, only acting after a return has already been initiated.

## 💡 The Solution: E-commerce Propensity Engine

E-commerce-Propensity-Engine is a proof-of-concept dashboard that shifts this strategy from reactive to proactive. By leveraging a machine learning model, this tool can predict the return probability for a transaction at the point of input, allowing a business to:-

Identify High-Risk Orders: Flag transactions that are likely to be returned.

Make Proactive Interventions: Offer targeted discounts, trigger manual quality checks, or send personalized follow-ups to mitigate the risk.

Gain Business Insights: Understand the key drivers behind product returns.
